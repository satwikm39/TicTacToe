# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description

The goal of this project is to create an android application in which users \
can play the classic of Tic Tac Toe. The user will be able to play against AI\
in three difficulty modes: Easy, Medium and Hard. The user will also have the \
option to play against another Human, either on the same device, or using \
Bluetooth on two different devices.
